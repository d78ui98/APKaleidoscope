It specifically targets the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, providing an easy and efficient way for developers, penetration testers, and security researchers to assess the security posture of Android apps.

## Features

APKaleidoscope is a Python-based tool that performs various operations on APK files. Its main features include:

- Scans Android application package (APK) files for security vulnerabilities.
- Covers OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to ensure a comprehensive security assessment.
- Utilizes Androguard for APK file analysis and vulnerability detection.
- Generates detailed and easy-to-understand reports for each scanned APK.
- Easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated security testing.

## Installation

To use APKaleidoscope, you'll need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can then install it using the following command:

```
