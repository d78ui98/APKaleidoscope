## Quick Reference

This cheatsheet involves various libraries, concepts in successfully building an android app. 

The best part about android is that all of the material is available online for free. The only thing required is thepassion and the 
dedication to learn new things.

As a newbie you will not require anything more than documentation of android developers and the problems at stackoverflow.
These 2 platforms are good to get started for any android enthusiast.

I would strongly recommend to go for the android course on Udacity by google. Its a series of 5 chapters that lets you understand the 
basics of android and further proceeds with concepts such as neetworking and data storage in android.
